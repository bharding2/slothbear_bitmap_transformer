## SLOTHBEAR BITMAP TRANSFORMER
* A bitmap transformer for slothbears

#### Functionality
* The best way to run this module is run ``` node index.js ``` from this folder.
* Alternatively, you can install the module globally from this folder by going ``` npm i -g ``` .  This is not really recommended, as it will store your transformed files way down in the depths of your node install.
* Once run, you will be prompted to choose which file to transform, and which transformation you would like to run.
* Your new file is then saved in the img folder.
* Huzzah, you have transformed a bitmap.  Your slothbear friends are very proud.

#### Dependencies
* Testing using Chai and Mocha.
* Tasks managed with gulp.
* Command line selection tool created using the Inquirer module by Simon Boudrias https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/
